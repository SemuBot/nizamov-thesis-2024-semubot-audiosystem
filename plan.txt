1)Work on sin measurements: measure sin waves and then transform that into ffts and from there calculate the SNR 

2)Similarly, by combining these measurements we can plot a graph of SNR to see how it differs at different frequencies

3)Repeat the basic voice measurements for a different string of voice from speakly in female voice ✔

4)Record the delta noise again. ✔

5)Read a few chapters of the book

6)Change the model for speech-to-text*

7)Add a 3D graph*

8)Word error rate calculation* ✔

THEN:

1)Repeat the same stuff, but without ALL OFF and see how it differs. ✔

2)Do a little study on materials for coating/capsule ✔

AFTER THAT:

1)Repeat everything, but with a new prepared capsule and see how it performs

FINALLY FOR THE PRACTICAL PART:

1)Connect it with the actual robot: connect to RasPi, connect the amplifier, connect the speakers and apply it to the robot to see its final function

2)Make a ROS2 publisher and make a ROS2 package

3)Write some more code for the audiodoa2.py* ✔
